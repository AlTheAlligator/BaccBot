✅ Second Shoe Mode — Structured Instructions for AI Integration
🧠 Context
Second Shoe Mode is initiated after a completed first shoe line, where the line has ended in a loss (drawdown is realized). Instead of continuing the same line, we evaluate whether we should start a new second shoe line based on cumulative drawdown and cube count.

📊 Conditions to Trigger Second Shoe Mode
Second shoe play is triggered only if:

There is enough total drawdown (amount not specified — assumed to be calculated programmatically).

There is a sufficient number of cubes left (at least 1).

The current lobby does not have a Player bias — it must have no bias or Banker bias.

🛠️ Second Shoe Line Preparation (Preset Sequence)
To prepare the new line:

Click "Player Start" mode.

Select "Player Only".

Press the W (Win) and L (Loss) buttons in the following strict sequence:

4x W
11x L
2x W
2x L

After the sequence, switch to "Banker Only" mode.

The line now has an initial virtual drawdown of -770, which must be factored into profit tracking.

🔍 Entry Requirements for Second Shoe Table
Once the line is ready, locate a valid Banker table:

The first 6 games must have exactly 4 or 5 Banker wins.

There must be no more than 1 Tie in the first 6 games.

⛔ Exit Conditions — When to End the Line
End the Second Shoe line if any of the following are true:

Net profit of the line exceeds +200 units (starting from -770).

Only 1 cube is left in the system.

The line is naturally completed by the system.

📈 Post-Play Tracking
After each second shoe line, record the result in the Google Sheet with ID 1040988089 under a dedicated sheet/tab for Second Shoe Lines.

🔒 Summary of Key Constraints for Bot Implementation
Avoid reusing any portion of the first shoe's line; treat Second Shoe as its own standalone line.

Always verify that lobby bias ≠ Player before initiating.

Line prep sequence must be followed exactly.

Validate table before starting to ensure statistical edge.

Log drawdowns and profits meticulously — second shoes are higher risk and must be monitored precisely.

Make sure that you don't break the regular 1st shoe flow, but reuse the code whenever it makes sense, so we don't repeat ourselves and have hell maintaining it
